# **SuMo Extension for VSCode IDE**

The SuMo Extension for Visual Studio Code allows Ethereum developers to use the mutation testing tool for Solidity Smart Contracts [SuMo](https://github.com/MorenaBarboni/SuMo-SOlidity-MUtator) in a very user-friendly way from the configuration of the tool to the visualization of the tests inside the Visual Studio Code environment. It enables the personalization of the SuMo configuration file, the selection of desired mutation operators, and the execution of all the SuMo functionalities handy.
Moreover, it provides access to associated test reports, allowing developers to easily identify lines of code with the respective mutant information. 
The streamlined workflow and visual representation of results make the mutation testing process more efficient and convenient for users.
