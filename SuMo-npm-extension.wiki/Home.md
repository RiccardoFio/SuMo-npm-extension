# SuMo-SOlidity-MUtator

Mutation testing is an effective method to evaluate the accuracy of a test suite in detecting faults. SuMo is a mutation testing tool for Ethereum Smart Contracts, which implements 44 mutation operators based on the most recent Solidity documentation and established mutation testing tools. These operators provide an extensive range of simulated faults that can be made by smart contract developers. The set of operators has been designed with the purpose of minimizing the generation of stillborn mutants, thus improving the speed and usability of the tool.\
